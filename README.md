# Stacks-and-queues

# Dequeue. 
A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) 
is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding
and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.

# Randomized queue.
A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random among items in the data structure.

# Permutation
client program that takes an integer k as a command-line argument;  and prints exactly k of them, uniformly at random.
